<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./site.png)

- Where can I see your demo?
- What was your experience? 
Tailwindcss felt slow at first, but later on it got a bit easier with each component variant
- What have you learned/improved? 
I learnt multiple ways of creating variants of a component with tailwindcss
- Your wisdom? :)
It's always good to push yourself to learn 1 more thing and get deeper with the stuff you already know
